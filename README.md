# Soaring-Around-Hyperspace
WebVR project using Aframe.js a JavaScript VR Library.


Made this as a tribute to one of my favorite rides at Disneyland's California Adventure Soaring around the World/California with the exception being this time taking to new heights out in hyperspace. This project was creating using the Aframe.JS library which can be found <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.3.0/introduction/">here</a>. Additional pixie dust sprinkled in through using custom textures derived from our own galaxy's space photography and Wookiepedia to figure out planetary movements and speeds. 

The WebVR experience itself lets you move freely throughout the galaxy using the arrow key pad. When a planet is encountered a label will appear telling you the name of the planet you just encountered. 

Included in this repository is the source html and Javascript code in the galaxy.html file and some clips of it rendered to get an idea of how it looks rendered in full hyperspace glory.
